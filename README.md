<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This project aims at retrieving data from an existing API and display its data which in this case invloves fetching the characters data of the one of the greatest series of all time -Game of Thrones - from an existing and free GOT api.</p>

<p>The project is a single page which includes a landing page, a search field that helps a user target a specific character, a card of characters with their details and finally a subscription form for news and events for the series 'stans'.</p>


<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Since this project only fetches data from a free public API, there isn't much, if any,setup required by the user required so as to interact with this project.</p>
